# Concept

OpenDolphin is a social network similar to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Mastodon.  
  
The product is intended to be an alternative to the commonly available
social networks that is centralized but secure by default.

## Centralized

Although a centralized platform can be more subject to censorship,
the problem about decentralized platform is entirely related to
content discovery.  
Whilst we'll try to find a balance between content moderation and free-speech, we believe the decision should be up to the end-users.  
This means that we'll not delete content that is not defined "illegal" (for which we're legally obliged to take down), but we'll put systems in place to de-prioritize in the discovery algorithm (suggestions)
any form of hate speech and racism (or basically, anything that is
not aligned with [our values](./OUR_VALUES.md))

## Security

- DMs are end-to-end encrypted
- Posts are signed with the user's private key, so that authenticity can be verified
- People can vouch for other people and confirm their real identity (peer verification) by signing a specific message with their key.
