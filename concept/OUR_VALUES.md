# Our Values

We value the users well-being. For this reason, we want to make
sure our platform is welcoming to everyone.
  
In our platform, we are all equal, and we respect each other.

## We value the users' privacy

- We can't read your private messages (DMs)
    - DMs will be E2E encrypted, the key will be on the users' side
- We don't share data you haven't agreed to share to third parties (unless required by law)
    - If we need to do it because of lawful interception, we'll keep a transparent log of the requests.
- We allow users to use pseudonyms


## We respect every gender, race, ethnicity, political representation

We strive to maintain respect and put measures in place to avoid racism or hate speech in general. 

## The users are in charge of the platform's content

We let everyone post whatever they want (as long as they comply with the law). We then let the community decide, based on likes and downvotes, what gets prioritized in the timelines.  
Content moderation, if available, will be transparent and peer-reviewed. Everyone should be able to contribute to the content moderation.
